# Zcash Python test vectors

Code to generate test vectors for various parts of Zcash.

The generated test vectors are checked into the repository:

- `test-vectors/json/*.json`: JSON format.
- `test-vectors/rust/*.rs`: Rust format, suitable for copying into a Rust library or
  application to use from `#[cfg(test)]` code.
- `test-vectors/zcash/*.json`: Bitcoin-flavoured JSON format (where 256-bit values are
  encoded as byte-reversed hex strings), for use in `zcashd` unit tests.

To generate the test vectors yourself (for example, to generate a larger set
after adjusting):

- Install [`poetry`](https://python-poetry.org/).
- `poetry install`
- `./regenerate.sh rust|zcash|json|all <scripts>|all`

To generate an individual output file:

- `poetry run SCRIPT_NAME [-t json|rust|zcash]`
  - `SCRIPT_NAME` is one of the scripts listed in `pyproject.toml`.
